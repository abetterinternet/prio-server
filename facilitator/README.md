# facilitator

This is ISRG's implementation of a Prio accumulation server. It ingests a share of data uploaded by a device, validates it against other facilitators, then emits the accumulated share to a Prio aggregator.

## Getting started

[Install a Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), then just `cargo build|run|test`.

## Generating ingestion data

To generate sample ingestion data, see the `generate-ingestion-sample` command and its usage (`cargo run -- generate-ingestion-sample --help`).
